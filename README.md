# Bellabeat (Capstone Project)

*Google Data Analytics Course Capstone Project*

Repository containg all the files that concerns the achievement of a capstone project from the Google Data Analytics Course.

Includes:
* Datasets
* RMarkdown Notebook  for the analysis
* HTML and PDF renders as Final Reports.

Plus, in order to share this work and build up a portfolio, I explored the Kaggle and Github platforms.
So, is also included the RMD file resulting of the rendering in Kaggle, and the MD file resulting of the rendering for Github in the remote project in RStudio.
